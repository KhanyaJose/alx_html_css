## Headphones Project

## Overview
This "Headphones Project" is a modern and responsive web application designed to showcase a fictional headphone brand. This project utilizes HTML and CSS to create an engaging user interface with sections such as "What We Do," "Our Results," and a contact form. It is also my first ever responsive web application so it has it's faults here and there but it is also a great example of what I have been learning at ALX Africa. It is an impressive responsive web application for someone who is a complete beginner. This project is the first of many more to come with better functionality to show my improvement from this project.
